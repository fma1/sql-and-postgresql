## Section 12 - Local PostgreSQL installation

Download the installer for your OS.

Run the installer and enter a password for the database superuser. I recommend you use "password" for now. Once installation finishes, open PG Admin. You'll get prompted to set a password, and I recommend using the same password as you enterd before.

Note for Mac OS X, you need to go to https://www.pgadmin.com/download .
